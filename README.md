## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: Ran into Xcode issues where the code wouldnt build. After a half-hour of attempting to figure this out I asked a friend to look at it. It built fine on his computer. Turned out it was Xcode not being 100% updatedâ€¦ 

Couldn't figure out how to append a dollar sign to the billfield text unit.
